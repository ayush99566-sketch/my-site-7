# Homepage Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimized homepage with smooth, lag-free animations using modern performance techniques.

## Key Optimizations

### JavaScript (`Home.c1dmp.js`)
- **requestAnimationFrame** for 60fps animations
- **Intersection Observer** for efficient scroll animations
- **Throttled scroll events** (16ms intervals)
- **Element caching** to avoid DOM queries
- **Hardware acceleration** with transform3d
- **Performance monitoring** integration

### CSS (`Home.css`)
- **Hardware acceleration** with `will-change` and `transform3d`
- **Efficient animations** using transforms only
- **Responsive design** with performance considerations
- **Accessibility support** (reduced motion, high contrast)

### Performance Monitor (`performance-monitor.js`)
- **Real-time FPS tracking**
- **Memory usage monitoring**
- **Automatic optimization suggestions**
- **Animation throttling utilities**

## Performance Targets
- **FPS**: 55-60 fps
- **Frame Time**: < 16ms
- **Memory**: Stable usage
- **Animations**: Max 8 concurrent

## Usage
The homepage automatically initializes with all optimizations. Performance monitoring runs in development mode.

## Browser Support
Modern browsers with Intersection Observer and requestAnimationFrame support.
